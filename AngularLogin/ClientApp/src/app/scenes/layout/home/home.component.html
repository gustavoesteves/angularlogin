      This project was developed based on the ASP.Net Core template with Razor. Some adjustments were made to back end and front end terms decoupled. First, change the Razor to Angular.io and then change the MVC to Rest API and deliver only JSON results.

    <p>The entire layout was based on the template "Editorial" of <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>. We decided don't included Bootstrap, the "Editorial" was complete for this task.</p>
